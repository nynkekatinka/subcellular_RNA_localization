# Subcellular RNA Localization

Repository for all code used in my master thesis "Statistical Inference of AI-identified Subcellular RNA Localizations".

* `io_data.py`, `CVAE.py`, `analyze.py`, `io_data.py`, `processing.py`, and `utils.py` were created by David Wouters, and were used to train and work with the CVAE model upon which this thesis is build.
